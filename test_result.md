# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

## Updated Implementation Summary

### ✅ **Phase 1: Repository Setup & Authentication**
- Successfully cloned the learning management system from GitHub
- Configured Google OAuth with provided credentials
- Updated environment variables and dependencies
- Verified both frontend and backend are running

### ✅ **Phase 2: Backend Badge System**
- **Badge Models**: Created Badge and BadgeCreate Pydantic models
- **Badge Creation API**: POST `/api/badges` - Creates badges when users complete courses
- **Badge Retrieval APIs**: 
  - GET `/api/badges/me` - Get current user's badges (authenticated)
  - GET `/api/badges/user/{user_id}` - Get public user badges
- **Badge Update API**: PUT `/api/badges/{badge_id}` - Update badge course titles
- **Authentication**: All badge endpoints properly validate JWT tokens

### ✅ **Phase 3: Updated Frontend Badge System**
- **Uniform Badge Design**: All badges now use consistent blue design with 🎖️ medal icon
- **No Score Display**: Removed quiz scores from badge display
- **Course Names**: Course titles are displayed below badges on profile
- **BadgeCollection Component**: Updated to show total count instead of score-based statistics
- **Profile Integration**: Added badges section to user profile page
- **Quiz Integration**: Modified course completion to award uniform badges for scores ≥ 60%
- **UploadedCourses Component**: Added section to display user-created courses (placeholder)

### ✅ **Phase 4: Testing & Validation**
- Comprehensive backend testing completed
- All API endpoints validated for proper authentication
- Badge creation, retrieval, and update functionality verified
- Frontend updated and compiling successfully

### 🎯 **Updated Key Features**
1. **Uniform Badge Earning**: Users earn consistent blue badges by completing course quizzes with 60%+ score
2. **Clean Badge Display**: Simple medal design without score or color coding
3. **Course Name Display**: Badge titles show the course name on user profiles
4. **Public Display**: Badges visible on user profiles with course information
5. **Clickable Navigation**: Badges redirect to their source courses
6. **Course Creation Section**: Profile shows placeholder for user-uploaded courses
7. **Authentication**: Secure badge system requiring user login
8. **Prevention**: No duplicate badges for same user/course combination
